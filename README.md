A game made with *no CANVAS* (HTML, JS, CSS).

by Milk-Cool



An evil square stole the stars from Candy country. And somebody need to return the stars (but not Dora, she's crazy). And "somebody" is... _YOU_. *So you need to return the stars. Yeah.*

Use <kbd>←</kbd><kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>→</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd> or <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to move. Start the tutorial level by just pressing *Let's go!* button. 

Play 15 awesome levels to get 15 stars!
